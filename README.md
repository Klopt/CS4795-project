# CS4795-project
Final project of CS4795

Dataset: A collection of handwritten digits, such as the MNIST dataset, which is a standard dataset used in pattern recognition.

Code: This will include scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The code will be documented and structured to allow for easy understanding and reproducibility.

Proposal: The detailed project proposal, outlining the objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes of the project.

Report: A report will be compiled at the end of the project, summarizing the findings, discussing the challenges faced, and suggesting areas for future research.

This project aims to not only apply the concepts learned during the semester but also to contribute a practical solution to the field of digit recognition, with potential for real-world application
